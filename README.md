Assignment 1 in Introduction to Computer Science I

The .py files in this repository were written for my first assignment in my Introduction to Computer Science I course at Carleton University.

The first part of the assignment was to reproduce a randomly generated image.

The second part of the assignment was to write a program that converts to and from uncommon units of measurement by using specific conversion factors.
