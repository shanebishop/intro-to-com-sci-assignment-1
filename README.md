Assignment 1 in Introduction to Computer Science I

NOTE: SimpleGraphics is a helper library that was not written by me; it is simply required for my code to run properly.

The .py files in this repository were written for my first assignment in my Introduction to Computer Science I course at Carleton University.

The first part of the assignment (a1q1-draw-professor's-image.py) was to reproduce a randomly generated image.

The second part of the assignment (a1q2-unit-converter.py) was to write a program that converts to and from uncommon units of measurement by using specific conversion factors.
